* Current Issue

The implicit conversion is working, which means that the underlying type is represented incorrectly (typeV), the pattern matching is correct, but the wrong method is being called. This is more concerning, 
it means that the type is being derived incorrectly and then validated in another way later.

** DONE fix the variant issues...
